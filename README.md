# perceptron-demo

Visualization of a 2D perceptron's learning process on HTML5 canvas.

See a [working demo here](http://ditam.github.io/demos/perceptron/perceptronDemo.html), or a [screenshot of the working application](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ditam/perceptron-demo/master/sample.png).

Created mostly in vanilla JS, the only external dependence is require.js.
